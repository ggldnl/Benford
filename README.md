# Analysis on the use of bedford law for deepfake detection

This project presents an analysis of using Benford's law for detecting deepfake images. Benford's law states that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the first digit is likely to be small (e.g. the leading digit being 1 about 30% of the time). We applied this principle to images and tried to establish if they were gan generated or not by analyzing the distribution of the first digits for the DCT coefficients and comparing it to the expected distribution according to Benford's law.
